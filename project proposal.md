## Project Proposal by Huiye Xie, Zhe Wang, and Huifang Ma.

## The Big Idea

- **Main Idea**:
   - Create a web based application that predicts users’ Today Fortune based on users’ input information and other interactive behaviours; 
   - The website should be good looking and fun to users;
- **Topics**:
   - Website building and design
   - design a functional algorithm that return useful and accurate results

- **Minimum Viable Product**:
   - the page should be easy to use
   - provide interesting results
   - the page can provide more detailed information if user enters more input
- **Stretch Goal**:
   - make it into a widget (one-time input and Fortune Predictions everyday)! 


## Learning Goals
    - To successfully create a web-based application to function as designed.
    - To be able to write functional algorithms that return desired results to our users based on information they enter.
    - To strengthen our understanding of python (function, database, libraries, and framework).
    - To cooperate with team members to adapt what we learn from classes to our project.
    - To write codes that can function well and to enhance logical thinking and analytical skills.


## Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Content Aggregator**: 
    - Use libraries such as *celery* or *apscheduler* to implement content aggregation as a background process.
    - May use “srapy” to “catch” content from online resources.
    

- [ ] **Web Design**
    - Use libraries such as *Flask* or *Django* to build website framework
    - Use java and Spring Boot to create a website: https://start.spring.io/


## Project Schedule

**In Shanghai Time Zone Dates**

- [ ] **02/25 - 03/09 12 days**: Gather information, research on reference projects, detailize the functionality of the project, determine necessary functions and frameworks that we need to learn, set up fundamenta codes and structures

- [ ] **03/10 - 03/30 21 days**: Create database and make it interesting, define most of the functions, fill in structures

- [ ] **03/31 - 04/07 7 days**: Work on web design, make it useable and friendly (if possible)

- [ ] **04/08 - 04/16 7 days**: debugging, testing with users, finalize deliverables


## Collaboration plan

**Michael** focus on the structure design and core functionality, later on switching into data cleaning and housekeeping
**Agnes & cathy** focus on data collection and organizing, fill in gaps between functions and visualized returns for users 
- we plan to first outline we need to do for this project, and then split the work and integrate after finish writing code for each part.



## Risks
- **Content**: we do want to make this project a useful and meaningful one, so we may need to do a lot of research online and move some content to enrich our results returned to our users. This will be a challenging part of the project.
- **Scraping**: not familiar with scraping technique, ignoring existing APIs, inappropriate crawling frequency, failure to dealing with target website changes
- **Formatting**: we are afraid that too many contents are returned to the user in one time, causing the page to look messy. We need extra work on the formatting of codes.
- **Web Design**: two of our members have experience with web design, but we are not so confident to use the same techniques in python to design a good-looking and well-functioned website.
- **Integration**: may have trouble with integrating codes,since this project will definitely involve at least tens of different functions and we need to make them “corporate” successfully with each other.


## Additional Course Content

- **Flask**: the web application course.
- **APIs**: we had discussion with professor before that we may need to use this technique in our project
